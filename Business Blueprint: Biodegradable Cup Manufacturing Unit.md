## 1. Introduction

This blueprint provides a comprehensive guide for establishing a small-scale biodegradable cup manufacturing business in India with an initial investment of ₹7-10 lakhs.

The following registrations are mandatory to operate the business legally:

*   **Company Registration:** With the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA).
*   **Udyam Registration:** To register the business as a Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprise (MSME) and avail government benefits.
