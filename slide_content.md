## Slide 8: Manufacturing Process: Simple, Scalable, and Efficient

The manufacturing process is straightforward and can be managed by a small team of three people. The automatic paper cup machine handles the core production steps - forming the cup body, attaching the bottom, and curling the rim - with minimal manual intervention. This simplicity reduces training requirements and operational complexity while maintaining consistent quality.

**Production Process:**
1. Raw material preparation: Paper rolls and bottom reels loaded into machine
2. Cup forming: Automatic shaping and sealing of cup body
3. Bottom attachment: Heat sealing of cup base
4. Rim curling: Final shaping for drinking comfort
5. Quality inspection: Visual and dimensional checks
6. Packaging: Sleeving and boxing for dispatch

**Production Capacity:**
- Single machine output: 40-60 cups per minute
- Daily production (8 hours): 19,200-28,800 cups
- Annual capacity: 50-75 lakh cups (at 80% utilization)

---

## Slide 9: Raw Material Supply Chain: Local and Reliable

Raw material procurement is critical for maintaining quality and controlling costs. Paper board with PLA coating can be sourced from major trading hubs in Delhi, Mumbai, and Ahmedabad. Establishing relationships with 2-3 suppliers for each material ensures price competitiveness and supply continuity. Monthly raw material investment of ₹4 lakhs supports production of approximately 12-15 lakh cups.

**Key Raw Materials:**
- PLA-coated paper board: ₹120-150 per kg (primary material)
- Bottom reels: ₹80-100 per kg
- Food-grade printing inks: ₹500-800 per kg
- Packaging materials: ₹20-30 per unit

**Supplier Strategy:**
- Maintain 2-3 suppliers per material category
- 30-day payment terms with established suppliers
- Monthly consumption: ₹4,00,000 worth of materials
- 15-day inventory buffer to manage supply fluctuations

## Slide 10: Government Support: MUDRA Loans and MSME Benefits

The Indian government actively supports small-scale manufacturing through various schemes. MUDRA loans provide up to ₹10 lakhs without collateral, making it accessible for first-time entrepreneurs. MSME registration unlocks additional benefits including priority sector lending, lower interest rates, and eligibility for government tenders. These incentives significantly reduce the financial barrier to entry.

**Key Government Schemes:**
- MUDRA Loan: Up to ₹10 lakhs without collateral at 8-10% interest

## Slide 11: Export Potential: Global Demand for Indian Biodegradable Products

International markets offer significant growth opportunities beyond domestic sales. The USA and Europe have stringent plastic bans and strong consumer preference for sustainable products, creating demand for affordable biodegradable alternatives. Indian manufacturers benefit from competitive pricing due to lower labor and operational costs. Export margins are typically 20-30% higher than domestic sales.

**Target Export Markets:**
- United States: Large market with high sustainability awareness

## Slide 13: Risk Mitigation: Diversification and Quality Control

Every business faces risks, but proactive strategies can minimize their impact. Raw material price volatility is managed through long-term supplier contracts and maintaining a diversified supplier base. Competition is addressed by focusing on niche segments and building strong customer relationships through superior service. Operational risks are minimized through skilled hiring and robust quality control systems.

**Key Risks and Mitigation:**

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|-------------------|
| Raw material price increase | Margin pressure | Long-term contracts, multiple suppliers, pass-through clauses |
| Intense competition | Price wars | Focus on service quality, build loyalty, niche targeting |
| Machine breakdown | Production loss | Preventive maintenance, spare parts inventory, service contract |
| Regulatory changes | Compliance costs | Stay updated, maintain certifications, industry associations |
| Customer concentration | Revenue risk | Diversify customer base, no single customer >20% revenue |
